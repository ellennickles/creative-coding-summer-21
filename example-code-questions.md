Figuring out how to ask questions in a technical class can be a learning process all its own. Here's a breakdown with examples to get the process started. Try to be as specific as you can. 

## I have a problem with my code.
* In line 87 of my sketch (provide link), why does the rectangle not show up in the center of the canvas even though I am calling rectMode(CENTER) in line 86?

## I need a break down!
* What does this error message mean exactly?

> p5.js says: You wrote rect(X,X). rect was expecting 4 parameters. Try rect(X,X,X,X). rect takes different numbers of parameters depending on what you want to do. Click this link to learn more: p5js.org/reference/#p5/rect

## Syntax
* What does "function" mean?
* I keep seeing `Unexpected identifier` in error messages. What is it?
* What is the plus for here?

```javascript
console.log("Position: " + x);
```

## Whys and Whatfors?
* Why would I make a number a variable that's never going to vary?
* What's the difference between "mousePressed() and mouseIsPressed"?

## Hows and Can Is
* How do I create an alternating pattern?
* How do I highlight something when I mouse over it?

## More examples please.
* What are some other mouse effects?

## What do the 8 numbers in a quad line of code mean?

```javascript
quad(138, 131, 186, 120, 169, 263, 230, 276);
```
